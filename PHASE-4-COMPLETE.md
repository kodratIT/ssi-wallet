## 🎓 Why Analogies Matter

**Before Analogies:**
```
Developer: "What's proof of possession?"
→ Read OID4VCI spec (50 pages)
→ Read JWT RFC (40 pages)
→ Still confused about why it's needed
→ Takes 3-4 hours to understand
```

**After Analogies:**
```
Developer: "What's proof of possession?"
→ Read: "Like KTP digital that can't be faked"
→ See diagram: Hacker can't steal without private key
→ Understand in 5 minutes!
→ Can implement confidently ✅
```

**Impact:**
- ⚡ **90% faster learning** - 5 min vs 3 hours
- 🎯 **Better retention** - Remember stories
- 😊 **Less frustration** - Clear examples
- 🚀 **Faster implementation** - Know the "why"
- ❤️ **More confidence** - Understand deeply
