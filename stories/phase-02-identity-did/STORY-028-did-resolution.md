    const agent = await getAgent();
    
    const result = await agent.resolveDid({ didUrl: did });
    
    if (!result.didDocument) {
      throw new Error(`Could not resolve DID: ${did}`);
    }
    
    return result.didDocument;
  }

  async getVerificationMethod(did: string, keyId: string) {
    const doc = await this.resolveDID(did);
    return doc.verificationMethod?.find(vm => vm.id === keyId);
  }
}
```
